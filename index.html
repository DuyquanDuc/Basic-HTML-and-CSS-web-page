        <p class="describe"> Hand made noodles in a wonderful old building is an option for lunch when visiting TIU. Soba is made from ground buckwheat and one of the most popular Japanese foods loved by kids, salary men, and ladies out for a lunch. The soba noodle is a food eaten during significant times of the year for the Japanese. Soba is especially popular during the New Year as the length of the noodle symbolizes the hopes for a long and healthy year ahead.
            <br> Soba is typically eaten with chopsticks, and in Japan, it is considered acceptable to slurp the noodles noisily. This is especially common with hot noodles, as drawing up the noodles quickly into the mouth helps cool them.

        <p><span style="font-weight: bold;"> Recommendation: </span>Mori/Zaru Soba (cold) </p>

        <p class="describe"> Sushi (すし, 寿司) is a traditional Japanese dish of prepared vinegared rice (鮨飯, sushi-meshi), usually with some sugar and salt, accompanying a variety of ingredients (ネタ, neta), such as seafood, often raw, and vegetables. Styles of sushi and its
            presentation vary widely, but the one key ingredient is "sushi rice", also referred to as shari (しゃり), or sumeshi (酢飯).<br>Sushi is traditionally made with medium-grain white rice, though it can be prepared with brown rice or short-grain rice.
            It is very often prepared with seafood, such as squid, eel, yellowtail, salmon, tuna or imitation crab meat. Many types of sushi are vegetarian. It is often served with pickled ginger (gari), wasabi, and soy sauce. Daikon radish or pickled
            daikon (takuan) are popular garnishes for the dish.<br>Sushi is sometimes confused with sashimi, a related dish in Japanese cuisine that consists of thinly sliced raw fish or occasionally meat.

        <h2 class="Store-name"> 3.Izakaya </h2>
        <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Izakaya+Ikkyu/@35.9137344,139.480401,17z/data=!3m2!4b1!5s0x6018da5966c6458f:0x5c26d4cb021970a9!4m5!3m4!1s0x6018da5966cfab15:0xeadb6450184f1f66!8m2!3d35.9137344!4d139.4825897"> 〒350-0043 Saitama, Kawagoe, Shintomicho, 2 Chome-10-7</a>
        <p class="describe"> Most guides and dictionaries translate izakaya as “pub” or “tavern”, but it doesn’t really fit neatly into either of these definitions (oh the woes of intercultural translation). Izakaya are different from bars in that diners are always seated and there is little opportunity for interaction with other customers. While drinking is a big part of it, there’s also a constant stream of (shared) dishes. It’s hard to classify the food other than “generally goes well with alcohol”.
            <br> In fact the menu can be so diverse that it can be a chance to try some dishes you haven’t tried before. Typical izakaya dishes include chicken karaage (Japanese-style fried chicken), yakitori, edamame, grilled fish, french fries, sashimi, sushi, ebi-mayo (fried shrimp with mayo), nabe (Japanese hotpot) and salads. Izakaya are also typically attended by large groups of friends or colleagues and are rarely a dating spot.

        <p><span style="font-weight: bold;"> Tips: </span> Rather than tipping or paying a traditional service fee, in an izakaya you pay otōshidai (お通し代) </p>
